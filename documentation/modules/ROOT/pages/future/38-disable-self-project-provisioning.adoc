Disabling Project Self-Provisioning

Disabling Project Self-Provisioning
Before continuing, make sure you’ve done the LDAP lab.
OpenShift, by default, allows authenticated users to create Projects to logically house their applications. This feature enables admins to provide a "self service" feature that was popularized by the advent of the "PaaS" (Platform as a Service) model.

This feature may not be suitable for all situations, and many administrators may want to have more control over Projects and who (if anyone) can create them. Some of these use cases may be:

Environment Protection - Administrators may not want Projects getting created without their knowledge.

Resource Allocation - Administrator may want fine grained control over resource allocation (i.e. "I don’t want to overcommit")

Quota flexibility - Default quotas may be set, but Administrators may want to specify additional quotas (or fewer) depending on the Project scope.

Accounting and Chargeback - In a multitenant system, there may be a need to do accounting and chargeback.

General Administrative Control - Administrators may want total control in what goes in an environment.

There are other ways to gain this type of control besides disabling Project self-provisioning.
Background: Projects
What are you disabling exactly? In a previous lab, you learned that a Project is a "bucket" of sorts; which holds all the resources for an application. You also learned that Projects can be assigned to a user or group for collaboration. But what’s the difference between a Project and a Kubernetes Namespace?

A Project directly maps to a Kubernetes Namespace. It also maps to the internal registry’s namespace as well as to a VXLAN VNID. So giving access to a Project does more than let users collaborate. You are allowing network communications, registry namespace access, and access to objects within a Kubernetes Namespace.

Examine the Clusterrolebinding
In order to examine the clusterrolebinding for self-provisioners; you need to be kubeadmin.

You could also use the serviceaccount user that we’ve used in previous labs. Since kubeadmin and the service account user both have the cluster-admin role, it really doesn’t matter.
oc login -u kubeadmin -p 4nyNM-BZtvz-Btyng-dTexX
View the self-provisioners cluster role binding usage by running the oc describe command:

oc describe clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners
You should see the following output:

Name:         self-provisioners
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: true
Role:
  Kind:  ClusterRole
  Name:  self-provisioner
Subjects:
  Kind   Name                        Namespace
  ----   ----                        ---------
  Group  system:authenticated:oauth
Here, it’s saying that the group system:authenticated:oauth (which is a group that every user that has authenticated is a part of, by default), is bound to the self-provisioners role. This role is a built-in role in OpenShift that allows the users to create projects.

If you are interested in the different roles that come with OpenShift, you can learn more about them in the role-based access control (RBAC) documentation.
To view the configuration itself, inspect the yaml by running the following:

oc get clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -o yaml
The configuration should look something like this:

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  annotations:
    rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "true"
  creationTimestamp: "2022-02-14T22:25:08Z"
  name: self-provisioners
  resourceVersion: "10620"
  uid: a0098c02-b9cb-4815-aebd-7dc44ef4d163
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: self-provisioner
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: system:authenticated:oauth
Removing Self Provisioning Projects
To remove the self-provisioner cluster role from the group system:authenticated:oauth you need to remove that group from the role binding.

oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -p '{"subjects": null}'
Automatic updates reset the cluster roles to a default state. In order to disable this, you need to set the annotation rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate to false by running:

oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -p '{ "metadata": { "annotations": { "rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate": "false" } } }'
View the new configuration:

oc get clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -o yaml
It should now have no subjects in the YAML. It should look something like this:

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  annotations:
    rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate: "false"
  creationTimestamp: "2022-02-14T22:25:08Z"
  name: self-provisioners
  resourceVersion: "55489"
  uid: a0098c02-b9cb-4815-aebd-7dc44ef4d163
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: self-provisioner
Test this by logging in as fancyuser1 and try to create a project.

oc login -u fancyuser1 -p Op#nSh1ft
oc new-project fancyuserproject
You should see an error message:

Error from server (Forbidden): You may not request a new project via this API.
Login as the kubeadmin user for the next exercise.

oc login -u kubeadmin -p 4nyNM-BZtvz-Btyng-dTexX
Customizing the request message
Now any time a user tries to create a project they will be greeted with the same message You may not request a new project via this API. You can customize this message to give a more meaningful call to action.

For example, you can have the users submit a ticket requesting a project. We can do this by changing the text given, to include instructions:

oc patch --type=merge project.config.openshift.io cluster -p '{"spec":{"projectRequestMessage":"Please visit https://ticket.example.com to request a project"}}'
Here, you are adding the projectRequestMessage and the value Please visit https://ticket.example.com to request a project to the specification.

Before you can see this new message, you’ll need to wait for the apiserver application to rollout the changes. This can take some time to rollout, especially on a busy cluster.

sleep 30
oc rollout status -n  openshift-apiserver deploy/apiserver
Now, the user will get this message when trying to create a project. Test this by becoming the fancyuser1 user.

oc login -u fancyuser1 -p Op#nSh1ft
And try to create a project.

oc new-project fancyuserproject
You should see the following message:

Error from server (Forbidden): Please visit https://ticket.example.com to request a project
Clean Up
Make sure you login as kubeadmin for the next lab.

oc login -u kubeadmin -p 4nyNM-BZtvz-Btyng-dTexX
Other labs may require the self-provisioners role, so let’s undo what we did:

oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -p '{"subjects":[{"apiGroup":"rbac.authorization.k8s.io","kind":"Group","name":"system:authenticated:oauth"}]}'
oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac self-provisioners -p '{"metadata":{"annotations":{"rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate":"true"}}}'
oc patch --type=json project.config.openshift.io cluster -p '[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/projectRequestMessage"}]'
