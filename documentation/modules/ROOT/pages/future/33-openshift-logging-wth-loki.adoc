= OpenShift Logging with Loki

== Summary - OpenShift Logging
In this lab you will explore the logging capabilities of OpenShift 4.12. This module will break down all the new logging features within 4.12.

An extremely important function of OpenShift is collecting and aggregating logs from the environments and the application pods it is running.

The cluster logging components are based upon Vector and Loki. Vector is a high-performance observability data pipeline that allows users to configure "log forwarders" to direct Openshift logs to different log collectors. Loki is log storage built around the idea of only indexing metadata about your logs with labels (just like Prometheus labels). Log data itself is then compressed and stored in chunks in object stores, or even locally on the filesystem.
[NOTE]
====
More information may be found on the official OpenShift documentation site
====
[NOTE]
====
This exercise is done almost entirely using the OpenShift web console. All of the interactions with the web console are effectively creating or manipulating API objects in the background. It is possible to fully automate the process and/or achieve the same results using the command line interface (CLI) or other tools, but these methods are not covered in the exercise or documentation at this time.
====
== Deploying OpenShift Logging
OpenShift Container Platform cluster logging is designed to be used with the default configuration, which is tuned for small to medium sized OpenShift Container Platform clusters. The installation instructions that follow include a sample Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR), which you can use to create a cluster logging instance and configure your cluster logging deployment.

If you want to use the default cluster logging install, you can use the sample CR directly. If you prefer to customize your deployment, however, make changes to the sample CR as needed.

The following describes the configurations you can make when installing your cluster logging instance or modify after installation. See the Configuring sections for more information on working with each component, including modifications you can make outside of the Cluster Logging Custom Resource.

[IMPORTANT]
====
We have set up an external OpenShift Console with kubeadmin credentials exclusively for this workshop. To access it, please refer to the workshop credentials page. Kindly refrain from using the internal OpenShift Console while logged in with the service account within this dashboard.
====
To enable metrics service discovery, add the following namespace label openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true".

The namespace is represented in yaml format as:
[.console]
[source,yaml]
----
openshift_logging_namespace.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: openshift-logging
  annotations:
    openshift.io/node-selector: ""
  labels:
    openshift.io/cluster-logging: "true"
    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
----
So create a file with the above YAML called 'openshift_logging_namespace.yaml'

Use that file to create the namespace by running the following command:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
oc create -f openshift_logging_namespace.yaml
----
Next, verify that the namespace has been created with this command:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
oc get namespace openshift-logging
----
You should see the following output:
[.console]
[source,bash]
----
NAME                STATUS   AGE
openshift-logging   Active   11s
----
== Install the Loki and Cluster Logging Operators in the cluster
In order to install and configure the logging stack into the cluster, additional operators need to be installed. we’ll cover below how these can be installed from the Operator Hub from within the cluster via the GUI.

When using operators in OpenShift, however, it is firstly important to understand the basics of some of the underlying principles that make up the Operators. CustomResourceDefinion (CRD) and CustomResource (CR) are two Kubernetes objects. CRDs are generic pre-defined structures of data. The operator understands how to apply the data that is defined by the CRD. In terms of programming, CRDs can be thought as being similar to a class. A CustomResource (CR) is an actual implementation of the CRD, where the structured data has actual values. These values are what the operator will use when configuring its service. Again, in programming terms, CRs would be similar to an instantiated object of the class.

The general pattern for using Operators is to firstly, install the Operator, which will create the necessary CRDs. After the CRDs have been created, we can create the CR which will tell the operator how to act, what to install, and/or what to configure. For installing openshift-logging, we will follow this pattern.

To begin, use the following link to log-in to the OpenShift Cluster’s GUI. (note: do not use the built-in console for these steps) https://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-kswh5.kswh5.sandbox1208.opentlc.com then follow these steps:

1 Install the Cluster Logging Operator:
[NOTE]
====
The Cluster Logging operator needs to be installed in the openshift-logging namespace. You can check that the openshift-logging namespace was created from the previous steps
====
.. In the OpenShift console, click Operators → OperatorHub.

.. Type OpenShift Logging in the search box and click the Red Hat OpenShift Logging card from the list of available Operators (choose the newest version you can see, which should be '5.8'), and click Install.

.. On the Install Operator page, select Update Channel stable. Under Installation Mode ensure that A specific namespace on the cluster is selected, and choose Operator recommended Namespace: openshift-logging under Installed Namespace. Leave all other defaults unchanged and then click Install.

2 Install the Loki Operator:

.. In the OpenShift console, click Operators → OperatorHub.

.. Type Loki Operator in the search field and click the Loki Operator card from the list of available Operators (choose the newest version you can see, which should be '5.6.1'), and then click Install.

.. On the Create Operator Subscription page, select Update Channel stable. You should also select 'Enable Operator recommended cluster monitoring on this Namespace'. Leave all other defaults and click Install.

This now makes the Operator available to all users and projects that use this OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

3 Verify the operator installations:

.. Switch to the Operators → Installed Operators page.

.. Make sure the openshift-logging project is selected.

.. In the Status column you should see green checks with either InstallSucceeded or Copied and the text Up to date.
[NOTE]
====
During installation an operator might display a Failed status. If the operator then installs with an InstallSucceeded message, you can safely ignore the Failed message.
====
4 Troubleshooting (optional/if needed)

If either operator does not appear as installed, follow these steps to troubleshoot further:

* On the Copied tab of the Installed Operators page, if an operator shows a Status of Copied, this indicates the installation is in process and is expected behavior.

* Switch to the Catalog → Operator Management page and inspect the Operator Subscriptions and Install Plans tabs for any failure or errors under Status.

* Switch to the Workloads → Pods page and check the logs in any Pods in the openshift-logging and openshift-operators projects that are reporting issues.

== Configuring a bucket with AWS
1 You should have received some AWS credentials. You can remind yourself of these on the screen from which you orignally accessed this workshop. You will need to use these credentials throughout the next few steps.

2 Firstly use the 'aws configure' command to set up your s3 (storage) bucket.

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
aws configure
----
Fill out the AWS Access Key ID and the AWS Secret Access Key from the credentials on the original access screen page mentioned above. Use us-east-1 as region and json as default output. This is an example below:
----
AWS Access Key ID [None]: w3EDfSERUiLSAEXAMPLE (PLEASE REPLACE)
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: mshdyShDTYKWEywajsqpshdREXAMPLE (PLEASE REPLACE)
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
----
3 Check the contents of the aws folder:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
ls .aws
----
you should see two folders 'config' and 'credentials'. This will be the location in which we will put the s3 bucket config.

4 Check that the instance was successful and that the information is correct:


[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
cat .aws/credentials
----
You should see that all the information is correct and matches your config. This is an example output:
----
[default]
aws_access_key_id = w3EDfSERUiLSAEXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key = mshdyShDTYKWEywajsqpshdNSUWJDA+1+REXAMPLE
----
5 Now it is time to create the bucket with the information that you have provided. You can choose whatever bucket name you would like. Pick a name you will be able to recognize later. In this case we have named it pg2nw which is the GUID of the console.

If you want to use your GUID as your bucket name please do the following:

to export we do the following:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
export GUID=`hostname | cut -d. -f2`
----
to view the GUID we do:

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
echo $GUID
----
The output of this command is your bucket name.

Next, run the following command to create the bucket replace <pg2nw> with your own GUID

[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
aws --profile default s3api create-bucket --bucket <pg2nw> --region us-east-1
----
This is creating an aws bucket from the profile called default which we set up earlier. Please remember your bucket name as we will be using this later.

You may get an error if you make the bucket name too generic. If you see something like this error, try another name:
----
An error occurred (BucketAlreadyExists) when calling
the CreateBucket operation: The requested bucket name
is not available. The bucket namespace is shared by
all users of the system. Please select a different
name and try again.
----
You will know you have been successful when you see this:
[.console]
[source,json]
----
{
    "Location": "/pg2nw"
}
----
== Creating a Secret within Openshift
Next you need to configure your secrets. This secret will store the access credentials for the s3 bucket we just created. This will later be used by the LokiStack to store logging data.

. Navigate to the Console and click Workloads → Secrets

. Next, select Create and from YAML

. Remove the current YAML and replace it with this YAML (Make sure to change to match your AWS creds):
[.console]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: lokistack-dev-s3
  namespace: openshift-logging
stringData:
  access_key_id: w3EDfSERUiLSAEXAMPLE (Replace with your aws creds)
  access_key_secret: mshdyShDTYKWEywajsqpshdNSUWJDA+1+REXAMPLE (Replace with your aws creds)
  bucketnames: replace with the name of your bucket (we called it pg2nw in our example)
  endpoint: https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
  region: us-east-1
----

Once you are happy, click Create.

Check that the lokistack-dev-s3 secret has been created by running the following command:


[.console-input]
[source, bash]
----
kubectl get secrets -n openshift-logging
----
 You should see something like this:
----
 [lab-user@bastion ~]$ kubectl get secrets -n openshift-logging
NAME                                       TYPE                                  DATA   AGE

deployer-token-65zmx                       kubernetes.io/service-account-token   4      7m51s
lokistack-dev-s3                           Opaque                                5      57s
----

== Creating the LokiStack
. Now, head on over to the console and go to Operators and Installed Operators.

.. Select the Loki Operator

.. On the first page under Provided APIs and LokiStack select Create instance.

.. Switch to YAML view option

.. Next you should remove the current YAML and replace it with this YAML:
[.console]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: lokistack-dev
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  size: 1x.extra-small
  storage:
    schemas:
    - version: v12
      effectiveDate: "2022-06-01"
    secret:
      name: lokistack-dev-s3
      type: s3
  storageClassName: gp2-csi
  tenants:
    mode: openshift-logging
----
This YAML will create a useable LokiStack. As you can see within this YAML it uses the secret file we created earlier.

.. Then click Create.

.. Navigate to the LokiStack tab and click on lokistack-dev.

It may take up to a minute to be up and running but it should eventually look like this:

image::lokistack.png[Loki Stack]
Figure 1: LokiStack

We haven’t set a ruler so you should see The field components.ruler is invalid.

== Create the Logging CustomResource (CR) instance
Now that we have almost everything set up we need to create our Logging CustomResource (CR) instance This will define how we want to install and configure logging.

. Head over to the console and go to Operators and Installed Operators.

. Select the Red Hat OpenShift Logging.

. On the first page under Provided APIs and Cluster Logging, select Create instance.

. Next, remove the current YAML and replace it with this YAML:

[.console]
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogging
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  logStore:
    type: lokistack
    lokistack:
      name: lokistack-dev
  collection:
    logs:
      type: vector
----
This will create an instance of Cluster logging within the namespace openshift-logging. It will store the log in LokiStack and the type of log it will store is vector.

Finally, click Create.

== Verify the Logging install
Now that Logging has been created, let’s verify that things are working.

. Switch to the Workloads → Pods page.

. Select the openshift-logging project.

You should see pods for cluster logging (the operator itself), the collectors, logging-view-plugin, and a variety of lokistack pods

Alternatively, you can verify from the command line by using the following command:
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -n openshift-logging
----
Which will eventually show you something like this:
----

----
You should see a box pop up in the top right corner after about 30 seconds to a minute. It will say "Web console update is available" and will prompt you to refresh your browser. Go ahead and do that; this change will now allow you to access logs.

If you come across any references to Fluentd status, kindly disregard them, as they are not relevant to our current task.

image::Loki_refresh.png[Loki refresh]
== Observing The Logs
. At this Point you can go to Observe → Logs on the left hand menu.

. Once you are inside you will notice a menu which is currently set to Applications. change this instead to infrastructure

You should now see all the logs for Infrastructure. The logs are split into 3 sections: application, infrastructure and audits. We will set up audits and the log forwarder in the next part, but lets have a look through the different parts of this.

image::appinfraaudit.png[appinfraaudit]
As we can see in the graphic below, you can filter by Content, Namespaces, Pods, and Containers. This can be useful to narrow down searches when looking for something more specific.

image::filterlogs.png[filterlogs]
You can further specify the logs you are looking for by using the other drop down menu for Severity. This menu breaks the logs down into critical, error, warning, debug, info, trace, and unknown logging categories.

image::severity.png[Severity]
The final piece of this is the histogram. This gives the user a more visual look into the logs.

image::histogram.png[histogram]
== Setting up Log forwarding
To have access to audit logs, we need to set up the log forwarder. We will start by telling the collectors to forward the audit logs through the cluster.

. Use the navigation bar on the left to access Operators → Installed Operators

. Now select Red Hat OpenShift Logging

. Under Provided APIs and Cluster Log Forwarder you should see a button named Create instance. Go ahead and select that.

Replace the current displayed YAML with the new YAML:

[.console]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  pipelines:
  - name: all-to-default
    inputRefs:
    - infrastructure
    - application
    - audit
    outputRefs:
    - default
----
Next, click create

You should now be able to go back to Observe → Logs and select Audit from the menu.

=== Congratulations, you have now completed the logging section!
