= Welcome to the OpenShift Roadshow Workshop
:navtitle: Introduction

This workshop will give you a hands on introduction to using OpenShift from the perspective of a developer, together with a view of specific topics on security, governance and management.

== Workshop Topics

There are two paths through this workshop. 

=== Application Migration & Modernisation

The first option has a focus on modernisation; taking an application from 'heritage' platform to running in a containerised format on OpenShift. In this section you will perform the following steps :

* Assess and Analyze an application for modernization
* Learn how to refactor and deploy a modernized application on OpenShift
* Learn how to implement CI/CD for an application on OpenShift

=== Security, Governance and Cluster Management

The second option has a focus on application and platform security, together with the management and compliance of multiple clusters. In this section you will perform the following steps :

* Learn the fundamentals of operating OpenShift clusters: Application Storage, Application Networking, Project Management, Authentication
* Learn how to discover security vulnerabilities across multi-cluster deployment
* Learn how to enforce security policies to keep applications from being run
* Learn how to deploy and manage multiple clusters with advanced cluster management

== Workshop setup

Two pieces of information are required to configure the workshop instructions so that the corect OpenShift platform and username are included in the generated commands. This ensures that when you copy commands from the guides, during the workshop exercises, they will work correctly within your specific environment.

Your course facilitators will provide you with :

* Common OpenShift platform URL
* Personal user ID for your use only

Enter the information into the two textboxes at the top of page. Remember to press *RETURN* after entering text into each field.

=== Introducing the OpenShift Environment

In this workshop you will use the OpenShift graphical user interface via a browser, and you will also use a command line interface.

==== Web user interface

The OpenShift web user interface is accessible at this URL :

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
https://console-openshift-console.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%/
----

Copy the above URL using the button to the right of the text and paste it into a new browser tab. This way you can keep the instructions and the workspace open at the same time.

Your username has already been given to you by the course facilitator. All users have the same password which is 'openshift'.

==== Command line interface

The OpenShift command line utilities that you need for the workshop can be downloaded from the the web user interface of the cluster. However, many users are unable or hesitant to download and install additional software so a command line interface is made available within the web user interface of the cluster. Additionally, there are more command line tools used for the workshop than simply the OpenShift command line. For example, we use curl to interact with applications, and it is easier if these command line utilities are made available quickly and easily.

To access the web based command line interface simply press on the '>_' icon in the top right of the screen as shown below.

This will launch the command line terminal at the bottom of the screen. After a short wait you will see the following text :

[.source]
----
Welcome to the OpenShift Web Terminal. Type "help" for a list of installed CLI tools.
bash-4.4 ~ $
----

To test out the web terminal try out these first couple of commands. Use the button on the right to copy the command and the paste into the command line window.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
oc whoami
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
oc projects
----

In the top right corner of the command line window there are three buttons.

* The arrow pointing to top right will launch the command line window in a separate browser tab.
* The horizontal bar will minimize the terminal window, which is useful later when you are doing a web UI based task.
* The cross will close the terminal.

That is all the setup work done - you are now ready to start experimenting in the next chapters.
