Project Template, Quota, and Limits

Project Request Template, Quotas, Limits
In the Application Management Basics lab, you dealt with the fundamental building blocks of OpenShift, all contained within a Project.

Out of the box, OpenShift does not restrict the quantity of objects or amount of resources (eg: CPU, memory) that they can consume within a Project. Further, users may create an unlimited number of Projects. In a world with no constraints, or in a POC-type environment, that would be fine. But reality calls for a little restraint.

Background: Project Request Template
When users invoke the oc new-project command, a new project request flow is initiated. During part of this this workflow, a default project Template is processed to create the newly requested project.

View the Default Project Request Template
To view the built-in default Project Request Template, execute the following command:

oc adm create-bootstrap-project-template -o yaml
Inspecting the the YAML output of this command, you will notice that there are various parameters associated with this Template displayed towards the bottom.

...
parameters:
- name: PROJECT_NAME
- name: PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME
- name: PROJECT_DESCRIPTION
- name: PROJECT_ADMIN_USER
- name: PROJECT_REQUESTING_USER
...
Next, let’s take a look at the help output for the oc new-project command:

oc new-project -h
Notice there is a --display-name directive on oc new-project? This option corresponds to the PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME parameter we saw in the output of the default Template.

The new-project workflow involves the user providing information to fulfill the project request. OpenShift decides if this request should be allowed (for example, are users allowed to create Projects? Does this user have too many Projects?) and, if so, processes the Template.

If you look at the objects defined in the Template, you will notice that there’s no mention of quota or limits. You’ll change that now.

Templates are a powerful tool that enable the user to easily create reusable sets of OpenShift objects with powerful parameterization. They can be used to quickly deploy more complicated and related components into OpenShift, and can be a useful part of your organization’s software development lifecycle (SDLC). More information can be found in the template documentation. We will not go into detail on Templates in this lab.
Modify the Project Request Template
You won’t actually have to make template changes in this lab — we’ve made them for you already. Use cat, less, or your favorite editor to view the modified Project Request Template:

cat /opt/app-root/src/support/project_request_template.yaml
Please take note that there are two new sections added: ResourceQuota and LimitRange.

Background: ResourceQuota
The quota documentation provides a great description of ResourceQuota:

A resource quota, defined by a *ResourceQuota* object, provides constraints
that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. It can limit the
quantity of objects that can be created in a project by type, as well as
the total amount of compute resources and storage that may be consumed
by resources in that project.
In our case, we are setting a specific set of quota for CPU, memory, storage, volume claims, and Pods. Take a look at the ResourceQuota section from the project_request_template.yaml file:

- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota
  metadata:
    name: ${PROJECT_NAME}-quota (1)
  spec:
    hard:
      pods: 10 (2)
      requests.cpu: 4000m (3)
      requests.memory: 8Gi (4)
      resourcequotas: 1
      requests.storage: 50Gi (5)
      persistentvolumeclaims: 5 (6)
While only one quota can be defined in a Project, it still needs a unique name/id.

The total number of pods in a non-terminal state that can exist in the project.

CPUs are measured in "milicores". More information on how Kubernetes/OpenShift calculates cores can be found in the upstream documentation.

There is a system of both limits and requests that we will discuss more when we get to the LimitRange object.

Across all persistent volume claims in a project, the sum of storage requested cannot exceed this value.

The total number of persistent volume claims in a project.

For more details on the available quota options, refer back to the quota documentation

Background: LimitRange
The limit range documentation provides some good background:

A limit range, defined by a LimitRange object, enumerates compute resource
constraints in a project at the pod, container, image, image stream, and
persistent volume claim level, and specifies the amount of resources that a pod,
container, image, image stream, or persistent volume claim can consume.
While the quota sets an upper bound on the total resource consumption within a project, the LimitRange generally applies to individual resources. For example, setting how much CPU an individual Pod or container can use.

Take a look at the sample LimitRange definition that we have provided in the project_request_template.yaml file:

- apiVersion: v1
  kind: LimitRange
  metadata:
    name: ${PROJECT_NAME}-limits
    creationTimestamp: null
  spec:
    limits:
      -
        type: Container
        max: (1)
          cpu: 4000m
          memory: 1024Mi
        min: (2)
          cpu: 10m
          memory: 5Mi
        default: (3)
          cpu: 4000m
          memory: 1024Mi
        defaultRequest: (4)
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 512Mi
The difference between requests and default limits is important, and is covered in the limit range documentation. But, generally speaking:

max is the highest value that may be specified for limits and requests

min is the lowest value that may be specified for limits and requests

default is the maximum amount (limit) that the container may consume, when nothing is specified

defaultRequest is the minimum amount that the container may consume, when nothing is specified

In addition to these topics, there are things like Quality of Service Tiers as well as a Limit to Request ratio. There is additionally more information in the limit range documentation section of the documentation.

For the sake of brevity, suffice it to say that there is a complex and powerful system of Quality of Service and resource management in OpenShift. Understanding the types of workloads that will be run in your cluster will be important to coming up with sensible values for all of these settings.

The settings we provide for you in these examples generally restrict projects to:

A total CPU quota of 4 cores (4000m) where

Individual containers

must use 4 cores or less

cannot be defined with less than 10 milicores

will default to a request of 100 milicores (if not specified)

may burst up to a limit of 4 cores (if not specified)

A total memory usage of 8 Gibibyte (8192 Megabytes) where

Individual containers

must use 1 Gi or less

cannot be defined with less than 5 Mi

will default to a request of 512 Mi

may burst up to a limit of 1024 Mi

Total storage claims of 25 Gi or less

A total number of 5 volume claims

10 or less Pods

In combination with quota, you can create very fine-grained controls, even across projects, for how users are allowed to request and utilize OpenShift’s various resources.

Remember that quotas and limits are applied at the Project level. Users may have access to multiple Projects, but quotas and limits do not apply directly to Users. If you want to apply one quota across multiple Projects, then you should look at the multi-project quota documentation. We will not cover multi-project quota in these exercises.
Installing the Project Request Template
With this background in place, let’s go ahead and actually tell OpenShift to use this new Project Request Template.

Create the Template
As we discussed earlier, a Template is just another type of OpenShift object. The oc command provides a create function that will take YAML/JSON as input and simply instantiate the objects provided.

Go ahead and execute the following:

oc create -f /opt/app-root/src/support/project_request_template.yaml -n openshift-config
This will create the Template object in the openshift-config Project. You can now see the Templates in the openshift-config project with the following:

oc get template -n openshift-config
You will see something like the following:

NAME              DESCRIPTION   PARAMETERS    OBJECTS
project-request                 5 (5 blank)   7
Setting the Default ProjectRequestTemplate
The default projectRequestTemplate is part of the OpenShift API Server configuration. This configuration is ultimately stored in a ConfigMap in the openshift-apiserver project. You can view the API Server configuration with the following command:

oc get cm config -n openshift-apiserver -o jsonpath --template="{.data.config\.yaml}" | jq  .projectConfig
There is an OpenShift operator that looks at various CustomResource (CR) instances and ensures that the configurations they define are implemented in the cluster. In other words, the operator is ultimately responsible for creating/modifying the ConfigMap. You can see in the jq output that there is a projectRequestMessage but no projectRequestTemplate defined. There is currently no CR specifying anything, so the operator has configured the cluster with the "stock" settings. To add the default project request tempalate configuration, a CR needs to be created. The CustomResource will look like:

apiVersion: "config.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "Project"
metadata:
  name: "cluster"
  namespace: ""
spec:
  projectRequestMessage: ""
  projectRequestTemplate:
    name: "project-request"
Notice the projectRequestTemplate name matches the name of the template we created earlier in the openshift-config project.

The next step is to create this CustomResource. Once this CR is created, the OpenShift operator will notice the CR, and apply the configuration changes. To create the CustomResource, issue this command:

oc apply -f /opt/app-root/src/support/cr_project_request.yaml -n openshift-config
Once this command is run, the OpenShift API Server configurations will be updated by the operator. This takes some time. You can monitor the rollout by waiting for the apiserver Deployment to finish:

sleep 30
oc rollout status deploy apiserver -n openshift-apiserver
This can now be verified by viewing the implemented configuration:

oc get cm config -n openshift-apiserver -o jsonpath --template="{.data.config\.yaml}" | jq
Notice the new projectConfig section:

...
  "kind": "OpenShiftAPIServerConfig",
  "projectConfig": {
    "projectRequestMessage": "",
    "projectRequestTemplate": "openshift-config/project-request"
  },
...
Create a New Project
When creating a new project, you should see that a Quota and a LimitRange are created with it. First, create a new project called template-test:

oc new-project template-test
Then, use describe to look at some of this Project’s details:

oc describe project template-test
The output will look something like:

Name:           template-test
Created:        22 seconds ago
Labels:         <none>
Annotations:    openshift.io/description=

                openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups=1000590000/10000
                openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range=1000590000/10000
Display Name:   <none>

Node Selector:  <none>
Quota:
        Name:                   template-test-quota
        Resource                Used    Hard
        --------                ----    ----
        persistentvolumeclaims  0       5
        pods                    0       10
        requests.cpu            0       4
        requests.memory         0       8Gi
        requests.storage        0       50Gi
        resourcequotas          1       1
Resource limits:
        Name:           template-test-limits
        Type            Resource        Min     Max     Default Request Default Limit   Max Limit/Request Ratio
        ----            --------        ---     ---     --------------- -------------   -----------------------
        Container       cpu             10m     4       100m        4       -
        Container       memory          5Mi     1Gi     512Mi       1Gi     -
If you don’t see the Quota and Resource limits sections, you may have been too quick. Remember that the operator takes a moment to do everything it needs to, so it’s possible you created your project before the masters picked up the new configs. Go ahead and oc delete project template-test and then re-create it after a few moments.
You can also see that the Quota and LimitRange objects were created:

oc describe quota -n template-test
You will see:

Name:                   template-test-quota
Namespace:              template-test
Resource                Used  Hard
--------                ----  ----
persistentvolumeclaims  0     5
pods                    0     10
requests.cpu            0     4
requests.memory         0     8Gi
requests.storage        0     50Gi
resourcequotas          1     1
And:

oc get limitrange -n template-test
You will see:

NAME                   CREATED AT
template-test-limits   2020-12-16T00:16:39Z
Please make sure that the project-request template is created in the openshift-config project. Defining it in the OpenShift API server configuration without having the template in place will cause new projects to fail to create.
Clean Up
If you wish, you can deploy the application from the Application Management Basics lab again inside this template-test project to observe how the Quota and LimitRange are applied. If you do, be sure to look at the JSON/YAML output (oc get …​ -o yaml) for things like the Deployment and the Pod.

Before you continue, you may wish to delete the Project you just created:

oc delete project template-test
