== Workshop Environment

In this workshop you will use the OpenShift graphical user interface via a browser, and you will also use a command line interface.

=== Web user interface

The OpenShift web user interface is accessible at this URL :

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
https://console-openshift-console.%CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN%/
----

Copy the above URL using the button to the right of the text and paste it into a new browser tab. This way you can keep the instructions and the workspace open at the same time.

Your username has already been given to you by the course facilitator. All users have the same password which is 'openshift'.

=== Command line interface

The OpenShift command line utilities that you need for the workshop can be downloaded from the the web user interface of the cluster. However, many users are unable or hesitant to download and install additional software so a command line interface is made available within the web user interface of the cluster. Additionally, there are more command line tools used for the workshop than simply the OpenShift command line. For example, we use curl to interact with applications, and it is easier if these command line utilities are made available quickly and easily.

To access the web based command line interface simply press on the '>_' icon in the top right of the screen as shown below.

This will launch the command line terminal at the bottom of the screen. After a short wait you will see the following text :

[.source]
----
Welcome to the OpenShift Web Terminal. Type "help" for a list of installed CLI tools.
bash-4.4 ~ $
----

To test out the web terminal try out these first couple of commands. Use the button on the right to copy the command and the paste into the command line window.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
oc whoami
----

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
oc projects
----

In the top right corner of the command line window there are three buttons.

* The arrow pointing to top right will launch the command line window in a separate browser tab.
* The horizontal bar will minimize the terminal window, which is useful later when you are doing a web UI based task.
* The cross will close the terminal.

That is all the setup work done - you are now ready to start experimenting in the next chapters.
