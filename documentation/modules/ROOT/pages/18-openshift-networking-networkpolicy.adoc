OpenShift Networking and NetworkPolicy

OpenShift Network Policy Based SDN
OpenShift’s default software defined network (SDN) inside the platform is based on Open Virtual Network (OVN), and is called OVN-Kubernetes.

Older versions of OpenShift may be running a different SDN, based on Open vSwitch called OpenShift SDN. As of OpenShift 4.12 OVN-Kubernetes has succeeded Openshift as the default SDN. To read more about OVN-Kubernetes, please read the official documentation.

The SDN is used to provide connectivity between application components inside of the OpenShift environment. It comes with default network ranges pre-configured, although you can make changes to these should they conflict with your existing infrastructure, or for whatever other reason you may have.

Kubernetes NetworkPolicy allows projects to truly isolate their network infrastructure inside OpenShift’s software defined network. While you have seen projects isolate resources through OpenShift’s RBAC, the network policy SDN plugin is able to isolate pods in projects using pod and namespace label selectors.

Switch Your Project
Before continuing, make sure you are using a project that actually exists. If the last thing you did in the previous lab was delete a project, this will cause errors in the scripts in this lab.

oc project default
Execute the Creation Script
Only users with project or cluster administration privileges can manipulate Project network policies.
Execute a script that we have prepared for you. It will create two Projects and then deploy a Deployment with a Pod for you:

bash /opt/app-root/src/support/create-net-projects.sh
Examine the created infrastructure
Two Projects were created for you, netproj-a and netproj-b. Execute the following command to see the created resources:

oc get pods -n netproj-a
After a while you will see something like the following:

NAME           READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
ose-1-66dz2    0/1     ContainerCreating   0          7s
ose-1-deploy   1/1     Running             0          16s
Similarly:

oc get pods -n netproj-b
After a while you will see something like the following:

NAME           READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
ose-1-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          38s
ose-1-vj2gn    1/1     Running     0          30s
We will run commands inside the pod in the netproj-a Project that will connect to TCP port 5000 of the pod in the netproj-b Project.

Test Connectivity (should work)
Now that you have some projects and pods, let’s test the connectivity between the pod in the netproj-a Project and the pod in the netproj-b Project.

To test connectivity between the two pods, run:

bash /opt/app-root/src/support/test-connectivity.sh
You will see something like the following:

Getting Pod B's IP... 10.129.0.180
Getting Pod A's Name... ose-1-66dz2
Checking connectivity between Pod A and Pod B... worked
Note that the last line says worked. This means that the pod in the netproj-a Project was able to connect to the pod in the netproj-b Project.

This worked because, by default, the networkpolicy lets all pods in all projects can connect to each other.

Restricting Access
With NetworkPolicy, it’s possible to restrict access in a project by creating a NetworkPolicy custom resource (CR).

For example, the following restricts all access to all pods in a Project where this NetworkPolicy CR is applied. This is the equivalent of a DenyAll default rule on a firewall:

kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress: []
Note that the podSelector is empty, which means that this will apply to all pods in this Project. Also note that the ingress list is empty, which means that there are no allowed ingress rules defined by this NetworkPolicy CR.

To restrict access to the pod in the netproj-b Project simply apply the above NetworkPolicy CR with:

oc create -n netproj-b -f /opt/app-root/src/support/network-policy-block-all.yaml
Test Connectivity #2 (should fail)
Since the "block all by default" NetworkPolicy CR has been applied, connectivity between the pod in the netproj-a Project and the pod in the netproj-b Project should now be blocked.

Test by running:

bash /opt/app-root/src/support/test-connectivity.sh
You will see something like the following:

Getting Pod B's IP... 10.129.0.180
Getting Pod A's Name... ose-1-66dz2
Checking connectivity between Pod A and Pod B............ FAILED!
Note the last line that says FAILED!. This means that the pod in the netproj-a Project was unable to connect to the pod in the netproj-b Project (as expected).

To list all the NetworkPolicy objects, run the following:

oc get networkpolicy -n netproj-b
You should see something like the following:

NAME              POD-SELECTOR   AGE
deny-by-default   <none>         3m19s
Allow Access
With NetworkPolicy, it’s possible to allow access to individual or groups of pods in a project by creating multiple NetworkPolicy CRs.

The following allows access to port 5000 on TCP for all pods in the project with the label run: ose. The pod in the netproj-b project has this label.

The ingress section specifically allows this access from all projects that have the label name: netproj-a.

# allow access to TCP port 5000 for pods with the label "run: ose" specifically
# from projects with the label "name: netproj-a".
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-tcp-5000-from-netproj-a-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      run: ose
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5000
    from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: netproj-a
Note that the podSelector is where the local project’s pods are matched using a specific label selector.

All NetworkPolicy CRs in a project are combined to create the allowed ingress access for the pods in the project. In this specific case the "deny all" policy is combined with the "allow TCP 5000" policy.

To allow access to the pod in the netproj-b Project from all pods in the netproj-a Project, apply the above NetworkPolicy CR with:

oc create -n netproj-b -f /opt/app-root/src/support/network-policy-allow-all-from-netproj-a.yaml
Listing the NetworkPolicies:

oc get networkpolicy -n netproj-b
This should show the new policy in place

NAME                                      POD-SELECTOR   AGE
allow-tcp-5000-from-netproj-a-namespace   run=ose        81s
deny-by-default                           <none>         7m11s
Test Connectivity #3 (should work again)
Since the "allow access from netproj-a on port 5000" NetworkPolicy has been applied, connectivity between the pod in the netproj-a Project and the pod in the netproj-b Project should be allowed again.

Test by running:

bash /opt/app-root/src/support/test-connectivity.sh
You will see something like the following:

Getting Pod B's IP... 10.129.0.180
Getting Pod A's Name... ose-1-66dz2
Checking connectivity between Pod A and Pod B... worked
Note the last line that says worked. This means that the pod in the netproj-a Project was able to connect to the pod in the netproj-b Project (as expected).
